Interactive Development Module Ngee Ann Polytechnic Assignment 2 (Marcus Hon Wei Yang) 
Student ID : S10207469
Name: Marcus Hon Wei Yang  


ShinyDex Web Application
Welcome to my Readme ! For this assignment i have created a website using html, css, javascript and PokeApi to create a functional website that allows you to look at a gallery of pokemon in cards as well as a pokedex (pokemon search device) which allows you to look for your desired pokemon by entering the correct name or number. 

Design Process
I've had many design ideas and thought processes when i was planning the layout and creation of the website. But i really wanted to include a video background that is high resolution to make the website look more lively and happening. Besides that, i played around with the shadow and animations to make my website look more interesting and functional. The color scheme that i went with was a blue-ish and glossy scheme so that the user can feel very at ease when they are using the website. Since i was a kid i was already very fascinated of the idea of pokemon and it felt exciting to me. This is why i want to try and capture that nostalgic emotion and focus on the visuals of the website so that i can get a strong hold of the user's attention. The target user for the website is has no age limit and can include anyone that has zero to little knowledge on Pokemon or for people that wish to learn more about Pokemon as a whole in a captivating way.
